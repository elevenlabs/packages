# ElevenLabs API Key
# Get your API key from: https://elevenlabs.io/app/settings/api-keys

# ⚠️  CRITICAL: Use a DEDICATED EMPTY TEST ACCOUNT
# 
# DO NOT use your production account or any account with deployed agents!
# E2E tests will create, modify, and DELETE agents during testing.
# Any existing agents in the workspace could be PERMANENTLY LOST.
#
# To set up a test account:
# 1. Create a new ElevenLabs account at https://elevenlabs.io
# 2. Generate an API key for that account
# 3. Use that key below
# 4. Keep this account empty - only for automated testing

# 2. Add your TEST account API key to .env
# 3. Verify the test account is empty
# 4. Run tests: npm run test:e2e
